I'm a second-year CS PhD student at Boston University, working with Professor [Aldo Pacchiano](https://www.aldopacchiano.ai/). My research interests include bandit algorithms, reinforcement learning, and online learning with a focus on safety constraints and optimal decision-making under uncertainty.

Prior to my studies at Boston University, I received my Integrated Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, where I worked with Professor [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/) and [Evripidis Bampis](https://webia.lip6.fr/~bampise/) on scheduling algorithms with predictions.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
